# React Redux Demo

This demo will discuss the use of Redux in React via Redux Toolkit, which simplifies the process of setting up and implementing Redux. To install Redux Toolkit run `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit`. We'll also be using `react-redux` - to install `react-redux` run `npm install react-redux`.

This demo is meant to be an overview of how to use Redux with React projects. It does not dive into the deeper conceptual underpinnings of Redux. You should finish this demo knowing how to use Redux in your React applications - you may want to read further up on <a href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts">how Redux itself works</a> if you're interested in what's going on under the hood.
